Fetal body detection with Faster R-CNN method (Using MatlabR2018a)

# Try with MatlabR2018a
Make all of file to one folder, then get training with Alexnet first, after get the result of Alexnet training save this to M.file. Get ready for training Faster R-CNN with transfer learning, it will be take many hours because the data and iteration too large, i already trained it but cannot push on github because is too large, if you want to download the data check this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mi8qo03do6J5CvFflKDFV_NqycTnFuEH?usp=sharing

# After download at GDrive
Take all of dataTraining at the same path on your dekstop (open file Path Dataset.txt) then open Matlab, after this open code editor and write "guide" --> open file sistem_deteksi_bagian_tubuh_janin.m --> press run button --> choose dataTest --> press button to detect.

Sorry my english is so bad, i hope you understand what i mean :)
